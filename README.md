# Agropilot
Open source Tractor autopilot by AgroTrack

After more than five years building gps guidance systems for tractors we decided to bring an open source autopilot for tractors, actually it includes a real-time dashboard integrated with firebase and python code to run autopilot on a raspberry pi 3.

GPS data is received via NMEA connected to a TCP server in Emlid Reach RTK receiver but can be modified to work via  bluetooth, serial or usb.
